                    This is an outreach therapy program of art, crafts and music
                    therapy that we carry out at Kenyatta National Hospital
                    (KNH) and at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH)
                    at the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Wards. We use therapeutic play,
                    art, music, knitting and beadwork (diversional therapy) to
                    demystify the cancer journey for children and teenagers, and
                    to help them cope with psychosocial wellness

                      Children can get pretty miserable and bored having to stay
                      for months on end at a hospital for cancer treatment. The
                      Crafts for Cure program takes place every Wednesday
                      morning and Friday afternoon at Kenyatta National Hospital
                      (KNH) run by Faraja and Nairobi University&apos;s AIESEC
                      students.

                    <p>
                      Craft for Cure enables these kids a welcome distraction
                      from treatments, the chance to hang out with fun people
                      and just get to be kids for an afternoon. Art therapy is
                      used to demystify complicated terms like chemotherapy and
                      as an outlet to deal with the side effects of cancer
                      treatment.

                    <p>
                      Around 300 children attend the Craft for Cure sessions
                      which target in-patient children at Level 1e, Level 3 and
