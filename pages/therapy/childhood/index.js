                              In Kenya the most common type of childhood cancer is leukaemia followed by retinoblastoma (eye cancer) and Wilms Tumour (kidney cancer).

                            <p>Sadly, only 20% of children with cancer in Kenya survive compared to the 80% who survive in developed countries. This can be attributed to the high cost of medicine, lack of proper community awareness, late diagnosis as well as the lack of specialized training.</p>
                            <p>Faraja is actively involved in the support of children with cancer in Kenya through our crafts for cure program. Our art and music therapy began in 2015 and involves us visiting the children at paediatric oncology ward at the Kenyatta National Hospital. We started with about 50 children in one ward and now see about 400 children every week from 7 different wards. In 2019, we begun visiting the children at the paediatric ward at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. We also give the children milk and fruit to not only supplement their diet but also give them a sweet treat, especially for those who may not receive regular visitors.</p>
